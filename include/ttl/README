This is a simple standard template library for C++ targeting the
pre-standard Norcroft ARM C++ compiler v1.11. The intent is to
replace the Roguewave STL implementation which came with ARM C++ due
to licensing concerns as well as to expand the APIs to more closely
match modern versions.

ETL (https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl) and similar libraries are not
usable due to the limitations of the compiler. Such as lacking
namespaces and incomplete or buggy templating.

Many things are incomplete or missing all together. Components are
mostly added as needed and may not be complete or performant.
