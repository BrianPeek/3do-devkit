<H1>Licensing Statement</H1>
<P>The Rogue Wave single-user license for this product allows a <B>single user on a single platform</B> to link against the product library. A multi-user license allows a <B>specified number of users</B> to link against the library. The fact that both the library and this documentation are easy to copy does not make it legal to do so. Without exception, legal permission for additional users to link against this library requires additional licenses or an upgrade of the multi-user license to include additional users.</P>
<p>For the specific terms of the license, please refer to the single-user license agreement delivered with your product, or to your company's multi-user license agreement.</p>
