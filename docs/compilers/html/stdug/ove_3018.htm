<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The Standard C++ Library provides a set of classes for reporting errors.  These classes use the exception handling facility of the language.  The library implements a particular error model, which divides errors in two broad categories: logic errors and runtime errors.</P>
<P>Logic errors are errors caused by problems in the internal logic of the program.  They are generally preventable.</P>
<P>Runtime errors, on the other hand, are generally not preventable, or at least not predictable.  These are errors generated by circumstances outside the control of the program, such as peripheral hardware faults.</P>
