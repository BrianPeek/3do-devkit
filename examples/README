The examples in "original" are from the original 3DO SDK releases
without any changes besides changing the text encoding from classic
Mac format. They won't be usable without some effort to move the files
into "takeme" and some possible modifications to account for changes
in the SDK over time or bugs in the original code. Keep in mind that
the 3DO Portfolio operating system had numerous releases and some
libraries changed over time. Non-Portfolio 2.5 / Toolkit 1.5 examples
may require more significant changes to work but most probably have
versions or alternatives in later releases.

The "reworked" directory holds examples "ported" to this 3DO DevKit
setup from the original 3DO SDK releases.

The "community" directory holds examples written by the 3DO homebrew
community.

The 3DO DevKit includes the "bootstrap-3do-project" script which will
create the setup for a new project. It is also designed to understand
the layout of these examples directory so you can simply run
"bootstrap-3do-project" within an individual example directory and run
"make" and "make run" to build and run the software in the Opera
emulator. On Windows either use a shell to go into the directory and
run bootstrap or copy the file from "bin/buildtools/win" to the
directory and run it from Explorer.
