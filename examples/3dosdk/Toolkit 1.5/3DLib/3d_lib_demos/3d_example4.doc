3dlib example4 documentation :

The example4 of the 3dlib was created to demonstrate the
use of new 3dlib calls in the beta release. A single world is created. At the
origin is placed a tumbling cube. Orbiting around the  cube is a pyramid.

This is just like 3d_example1, except it attaches a light-source to the
orbiting pyramid as well as a 3D sound (use headphones).

Make sure you install "Rumble.aiff" in your remote/aiff directory.

Once you start the animation, the joypad controls will change various
elements:

Button A does nothing.

Button B will cause the camera to pan CW.

Button C will freeze the animation.

The up/down positions on the pad will move the camera up and
down along the y-axis. Left/right will move it side to side along the x-axis.

Exit the example by using the "enter" button.

Most of the stuff in 3d_example1_core.c is not needed specifically
for 3d use, but is merely set up and driver code.
