3Dlib-Beta 2 Release, June 25, 1993

WARNING:

Since you are receiving the source code you have authority to modify
it as needed. But be forwarned that the code will be updated regularly.

If you use our library as supplied you have our support. If you
modify it, you're on your own.

Installation :

All deliverables go into the source directory, except for the 3 image 
files, "backdrop.3do", "sw.cel", "alt.cel" which go into the directory
used to execute the examples (probably "remote"), and 3d.lib
which goes into the library folder. There is one sound, "Rumble.aiff", that
needs to be put into "remote/aiff".

Compiling this stuff:

In order to compile the examples and library, merely set your MPW
directory to the 3dlib directory. MPW should then search for
"Makefile" and will add to the Build menu "3d_example1", "3d_example2",
"3d_example3", "3d_example4", and "td". 

Make sure that you have a directory called "objects" in each of the 
folders.

If you want to rebuild the library, you will need ARMlib.
