Use the MPW tool ProtoTestData to generate some test data:
	prototestdata -nc 50 -o proto.chunky

Use the Weaver to make a fully qualified stream:
	weaver -o proto.stream <proto.weavescript
	
	The weavescript only needs to contain the following command:
			File	proto.chunky	0	0

Use 3DODebug to run the ProtoPlayer:
	ProtoPlayer /remote/proto.stream

After you quit, the subscriber will have dumped two files into
/remote.  The first, "ProtoTraceRawDump.txt" contains the raw
trace events; and the second, "ProtoTraceStats.txt" some timing
statistic about how long it took to consume the data.  

First convert the linefeeds in the raw trace dump to carriage 
returns.  I do this by opening the file in Alpha and re-saving
it in Mac format.

Finally, use the MPW tool canon to convert the trace codes to text:
	canon ProtoTrace.dict <ProtoTraceRawDump.txt >ProtoTrace.txt

If you have InControl, you can copy and paste the trace dump into
the template I've provided.  This makes viewing much easier.  Then
you can use the sort and search functions to analyze the data.
