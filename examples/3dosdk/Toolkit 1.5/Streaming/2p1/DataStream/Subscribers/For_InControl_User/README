TraceDumpTemplate and TraceStatsTemplate are InControl Documents
and are only useful if you have InControl.  These templates are
provided to facilitate the viewing of trace dumps.

How to use the templates:
1)	Convert the linefeeds in the raw trace dump to carriage returns. 
2)	Use the MPW tool canon to convert the trace codes to text:
	canon SAudioTrace.dict < SATraceRawDump.txt > SATrace.txt. 
From the InControl application, copy and paste the trace dump into the template.
You can use the sort and search functions to analyze the data.
