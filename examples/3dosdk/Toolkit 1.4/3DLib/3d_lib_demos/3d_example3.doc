3dlib example3 documentation :

	The example3 of the 3dlib was created to demonstrate the
use of the basic 3dlib calls. A single world is created. At the
origin is placed a tumbling cube. Orbiting around the  cube is a pyramid,
with another cube and 3 other pyramids doing strange and exotic
things. The eyepoint is a always centered on the closest cube.

This also demonstrates CloneObject() and LookAt().

The joypad will control several elements of the demo:

Button A will modify the CCB on the fly and will toggle Doloresizing.

Button B will cause the camera to roll CW.

Button C will freeze the animation.

The up/down positions on the pad will move the camera up and
down. Left/right will move it side to side along the x-axis.
Pressing the pad once will start the motion, pressing it a second
time will stop it.  

Exit the example by using the "enter" button.

This also gives an example of how to use the eventbroker for 
joystick operations.
