3dlib example2 documentation :

	The example2 of the 3dlib was created to demonstrate a few
more options available, and to build up a bigger universe than
example1. This creates two "worlds". World1 is populated with 3 objects,
a tumbling cube placed at the origin, a rotating pyramid behind the cube,
and a combination pyramid/cube object that orbits the cube. Object3 
demonstrates the multiple levels of details which a thing can have. When
closer to the camera you see a cube, when further away it changes to 
a pyramid. World1 also has two cameras, which are toggled by the C button
on the joypad.

World2 has a single pyramid, tumbling at the origin.

The up/down positions on the pad will move camera1 in world1 up and
down. Left/right will move the camera side to side along the x-axis.
The B button will cause the camera to pan CW. 

You may toggle between both worlds with the A button.

Exit the example by using the "enter" button.

This example also shows how you can modify an object's ccb and
have different bitmaps for each face if you are so inclined.
