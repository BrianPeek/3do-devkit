#  Example Script to demonstrate Processing Graphics with PPM Tools
#  David Maynard
#  The 3DO Comapany
#  January 6, 1994
#
#  This example takes 10 Targa files and creates a 3DO anim file.
#  
#  These files were created on an IBM PC using software from 
#     "Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C"
#       by Christopher D. Watkins
#          Stephen B. Coy
#          and Mark Finlay
#       (c) 1992 by M&T Publishing, Inc.
#       ISBN # 1-55851-247-0
#
#  These files were ray traced in 24 Bit color and converted 
#  to TGA (Targa) format on the IBM PC
#
#  Lets create an uncoded 16 anim file.
#
#   Convert each Targa File to PPM format
