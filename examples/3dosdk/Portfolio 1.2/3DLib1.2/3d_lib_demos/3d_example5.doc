3dlib example5 documentation : (modified Dec. 8, 1993)

The example5 of the 3dlib was created to demonstrate the
use of new 3dlib calls in release 1.1. A single world with two cubes 
is created.

The closest cube is fixed, but is defined as an interpolated meshed-object
so you can move your eyepoint extremely close. The object will switch over 
to the mesh at a distance of 2. A 4x4 grid is used, so each parent face turns
into 16 sub-faces.

The second cube behind and to the right is yet another one of the 
tumbling cubes, but with a twist. Two faces are now animated using
the new ScrollCel() routine. The astronaut picture will scroll around and
zoom in and out.
