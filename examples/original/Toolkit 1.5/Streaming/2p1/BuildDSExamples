#	History:
#	08/17/94	dtc		Don't build TestDS (obsoleted) and ShuttlePlayer.
#	05/16/94	dtc		Quoted "{ExampleRootName}" variable to allow spaces in
#						folder names.
#						Check if make file exists before building example.
#	11/22/93	jb		Change to build a folder of examples 
#	11/9/93		jb		Split out from BuildDS to build just test programs
#	10/26/93	jb		Add build commands for PlaySA; modify
#						build commands for sample applications to be boilerplate
#						set of commands that depends on the shell variable
#						"{SampleApp}" for easier maintenence.
#	10/19/93	jb		Add build commands for TestSA and PlaySAnim test programs
#	7/9/93		jb		Save and restore the state of {Exit} around the 
#						deletion of files if "clean" option selected.
#	6/27/93		jb		Allow command line specification of root directory
#						Add "clean" option to specify deletion of ALL
#						object files prior to building.
#	6/24/93		jb		New today.
