Perftest : 3d.lib performance demonstrator

This is used to demonstrate general performance levels of 3d.lib, and by 
extension, the overall 3DO system in general.

It will create a single world and a field of 25 cubes in a 5 by 5 array.
Button A will cause any eyepoint or cube motion to freeze, Button B 
will cycle you through several different options (the current options
will be printed out to the terminal window), and Button C will move
your eyepoint along the direction of sight letting you fly around the
field. Use the control pad to aim you line of sight.

This will show the relative performance of flat shaded CCBs vs. images,
large images vs. small images, flat lighting vs. real lighting and
motionless objects vs. rotating ones.

Feel free to modify the source to more closely approximate your own
situation.

The following are some rough numbers generated without moving the eyepoint
from the startup position, for the first set of options with image based 
faces (click button B 3 times to get past the flat colored cubes).

The times are for 100 frames.

unpacked, uncoded 16, 1 corner engine, no superclipping :

	50 seconds : 2.0 fps

unpacked,  uncoded 16, both corner engines, no superclipping :

	36 seconds : 2.7 fps

   "              ", with superclipping :

	34 seconds : 2.9 fps

as above, but using packed data :

	24 seconds : 4.1 fps

as above, but now using coded 8 data :

	18 seconds : 5.6 fps

as above, but with coded 4

	17 seconds : 5.9 fps
