3dlib example1 documentation :

The example1 of the 3dlib was created to demonstrate the
use of the basic 3dlib calls. A single world is created. At the
origin is placed a tumbling cube. Orbiting around the  cube is a pyramid.

Once you start the animation, the joypad controls will change various
elements:

Button A will modify the CCB on the fly and will toggle Doloresizing.

Button B will cause the camera to pan CW.

Button C will freeze the animation.

The up/down positions on the pad will move the camera up and
down. Left/right will move it side to side along the x-axis.

Exit the example by using the "enter" button.

Most of the stuff in 3d_example1_core.c is not needed specifically
for 3d use, but is merely set up and driver code.

This also gives an example of how to use the eventbroker for 
joystick operations.

For slightly more complex 3d operations see 3d_example2. It will
put different images on the faces, manipulate multiple cameras and
worlds and demonstrate multiple levels of detail.

3d_example3 shows how to use the LookAt() command to keep on point
centered all of the time.

3d_example4 is just like this version except that it demonstrates
3D-Audio and lighting effects.
